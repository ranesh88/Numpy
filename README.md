# Numpy

NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is open-source software.

Features of NumPy

NumPy has various features including these important ones:

A powerful N-dimensional array object

Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions

Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy in Python can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data types can be defined using Numpy which allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
